##Introduction 
Point cloud completion is a crucial task in 3D computer vision and graphics, aimed at predicting and reconstructing missing parts of 3D point clouds. Point clouds are collections of data points in a 3D coordinate system, representing the external surface of objects or scenes. However, due to various limitations in data acquisition processes, these point clouds often contain incomplete or missing data. This project leverages the PointNet architecture to address this challenge by directly processing raw point cloud data to perform completion tasks. PointNet is renowned for its ability to handle unordered point sets and capture both local and global geometric features efficiently. By utilizing this architecture, our implementation seeks to enhance the accuracy and reliability of point cloud completion, providing a robust solution for applications in 3D modeling, computer-aided design (CAD), virtual reality (VR), and more.
